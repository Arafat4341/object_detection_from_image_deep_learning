# object_detection_from_image_deep_learning

This Ipython notebook is a full hand-note of implementation of Deep Learning in object detection from image. We used the famous 'ResNet50' model with the pretrained weight values for classifying objects from image.
We also implemented transfer learning concept for using the same model to a new task that classifies whether a photo is urban or rural.
